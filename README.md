# Blippics
A web app made with NodeJS and Express.

## About

Blippics was initially the product of a final project in one of my previously courses at Linnaeus university. Blippics has however been undergoing several updates ever since and still is. The main idea with the Blippics site is to offer you the tools you need to edit your desired images. This application gives you the chance to edit your images from your computer, Google Drive, Dropbox and OneDrive. When you are done editing you can choose to either download the image or upload it to the cloud of the choosen service.
