      Blippics was initially the product of a final project in one of my previously
      courses at Linnaeus university. Blippics has however been undergoing several
      updates ever since and still is. The main idea with the Blippics site
      is to offer you the tools you need to edit your desired images.
      This application gives you the chance to edit your images from
      your computer, Google Drive, Dropbox and OneDrive. When you are
      done editing you can choose to either download the image or upload
      it to the cloud of the choosen service.

      I hope you enjoy this site as much I did making it.

    <p class="text">
      Happy editing!

      The photo editor can open images in all resolutions.
      However, by default, the photo editor works on a medium resolution
      image in order to speed up the performance of the editor.
      This means it will save a high-res image in lower quality.
